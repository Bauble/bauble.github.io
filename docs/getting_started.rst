Introduction
------------
Bauble is an opinionated plant collection manager that allows an individual or an organization to manage their plant collections from their computer or mobile device and to host that collection in the "cloud".

Digital plant collection management is not unique to Bauble but it does have some features that sets it apart from similar systems including:

  - It is built for the build.
  - It is open source.
  - It reduces the potential for bad data.



Create a new account
--------------------
Every account on Bauble is also part of an organization.  Organizations allow more than one user to manage a plant collection.  At the moment there is no way to restrict what a particular user can an can't edit in a collection so only allow someone access to your collection if they are somone you can trust.

.. highlights::
   The organizations **name** and short **name** are not required
   to be unique but these field are used when exporting your data.  If your
   organization is registered with `BGCI<http://bgci.org>` then the short name
   should be the same as the *Institution Code* registered with the BGCI.

After creating a new account you plant collection records will be populated with a comprehensive set of accepted vascular plant families and genera.
