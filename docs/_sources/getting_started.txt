Create a new account
--------------------

Every account on Bauble is also part of an organization.  Organizations allow more than one user to manage a plant collection.  At the moment there is no way to restrict what a particular user can an can't edit in a collection so only allow someone access to your collection if they are somone you can trust.

.. highlights::
   The organizations **name** and short **name** are not required
   to be unique but these field are used when exporting your data.  If your
   organization is registered with `BGCI<http://bgci.org>` then the short name
   should be the same as the *Institution Code* registered with the BGCI.
