Thanks for tuning in to the first blog post for Bauble.  For those of you that
don't know Bauble is a new web app for managing plant collections.  It is
primarily for botanic gardens and arboreta to manage their living collections
using modern curatorial practices.

Bauble was started as an open source project in 2004 at
[Belize Botanic Gardens](http://belizebotanic.org) and was freely available to
anyone who wanted to use it.  The original version of Bauble, or Bauble
Classic, was a desktop application that you installed on your computer.  

The fruit hasn't fallen farm from the tree. Bauble is still an open source
project but it has moved on from it's humble beginnings and is now an advanced,
modern web app that allows you to host your plant records in the cloud.

Here at Bauble.io we are offering a hosted version of Bauble for your
convenience.  The infrastructure for your plant records require continous
backups, servers, IT staff, support and a whole list of headaches.  Garden
staff should be concerned with managing the plant collections and landscapes
and not their IT infrastructure.
