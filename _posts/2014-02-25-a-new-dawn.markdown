Thanks for tuning in to our first blog post.  For those of you that
don't know Bauble is a web app for managing plant collections.  It is
primarily for botanic gardens and arboreta to manage their living collections
using modern curatorial practices.

Bauble was started as an open source project in 2004 at
[Belize Botanic Gardens](http://belizebotanic.org) and was freely available to
anyone who wanted to use it.  The original version of Bauble, or Bauble
Classic, was a desktop application that you installed on your computer.

The fruit hasn't fallen far from the tree. Bauble is still an
[open source](http://opensource.org/) project but it has moved on from it's
humble beginnings and is now an advanced, modern web app that allows you to
host your plant records in the cloud.

Here at Bauble.io we are offering a hosted version of Bauble for your
convenience.  That means you don't need to worry about the continous
maintenance, backups, servers, IT staff, support and a whole list of headaches
that comes with managing your plant records.  By using Bauble you can spend
time managing your collection and landscapes and not your IT infrastructure.

Bauble.io isn't quite ready for prime time but we're shooting for our first
release in the beginning of Summer 2014.
